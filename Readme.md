# Coursera - Getting and Clearning Data - Final Project #

## Repository contents ##

This repository includes the following files and directories:

- **run_analysis.R** - the script file that processes the data
- **CodeBook.md/CodeBook.html** - the file that explains the variables and how they were changed to achieve the result
- **filteredData.csv** - cleaned up data from the run_analysis.R script
- **tidyData.csv** - averages for the cleaned up data, 2nd file generated by the run_analysis.R script
- **tidyData.txt** - a text version of the tidyData.csv file as requested after I started my submission
- **raw-data/** - directory containing the data to be processed
- **README.md/README.html** - the file you are reading now - with the description of the project and the information in the repository.


## What the script does ##

The script **run_analysis.R** does the following:

- reads the test and training data sets from **/raw-data/** into R
- merges and cleans up the data sets
- creates easy to read labels for the variables
- extracts only the information related to the *mean* and *standard deviation* variables
- next, it groups the data by *SubjectID* and *Activity* and averages each of the variables from the previous data set
- both data sets are also saved as .csv files **filteredData.csv** for the first data set **tidyData.csv** for the second data set (also creates a **tidyData.txt** as requested in the submission guidelines)


## To use ##

To clean the data, just run the [**run_analysis.R**](run_analysis.R) script.
